Great execution starts with a plan.  The plan sets the stage with strategy (**the why**), then lays out the objectives (**the what**), and then the required steps and actions (**the how**), to be carried out by the respective members (**the who**), and the timeframe in which the actions should be accomplished (**the when**).
