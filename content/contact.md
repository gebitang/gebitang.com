Plan -- Focus -- Motivate -- Measure -- Reward 

Plan
Great execution starts with a plan.  The plan sets the stage with strategy (the why), then lays out the objectives (the what), and then the required steps and actions (the how), to be carried out by the respective members (the who), and the timeframe in which the actions should be accomplished (the when).   

Like the vision, it needs to be clear.  Unlike the vision, it needs to be as comprehensive as possible, with a robust appreciation of the risks and challenges, and well thought-out “plan B’s” for all the major risk points or hurdles.

"Good business leaders create a vision, articulate the vision, passionately own the vision, and relentlessly drive it to completion." - Jack Welch
