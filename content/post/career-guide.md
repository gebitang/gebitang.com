### First, what makes for a dream job?
Research suggests focusing on six key factors:

1. Work that helps others
2. Work you’re good at
3. Engaging work - autonomy, clear tasks, feedback, variety
4. Colleagues you get on with
5. A job that meets your basic needs, like fair pay and reasonable hours.
6. A job that fits with the rest of your life.

- What have you found most fulfilling in the past?
- What have you found least fulfilling in the past?
- If you were going to die in ten years, what would you do? What does this tell you about your dream job?


### What's the most valuable career capital you already have?
Consider your:

- Transferable skills (e.g. ability to learn quickly)
- Knowledge 
- Personality traits (e.g. conscientiousness)
- Connections
- Credentials (e.g. degrees, unique achievements)
- Runway (i.e. savings)

If you're stuck, list out the five achievements you're most proud of, and ask what they have in common.

### 2-5 promising longer-term career options?

### the best approaches for making progress on solving the global problems

A very common decision-making trap is to focus on too narrow a set of options. Use the following questions to generate more options:

1. If you couldn’t take any of the options you wrote down in the previous question, what would you do? 
2. If money were no object, what would you do? 
3. What do your friends advise? 
4. How you might be able to combine your options to get the best of both worlds?


### Assess your options on how well they do

- (a) social impact
- (b) personal fit 
- \(c) other factors for job satisfaction

>One of the most pernicious enemy of good decision-making is “confirmation bias,” which is our tendency to seek out information that supports what we want to be true, while failing to seek out contradictory information.

>>Imagine that the option you ranked number 1, will actually turn out to be a terrible option. Where could you go looking for proof of that right now? 
Write down 1-2 ideas.

SO, If your best friend was choosing between the same options as you, what would you tell them to do?
