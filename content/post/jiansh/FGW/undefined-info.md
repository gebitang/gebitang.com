Gino: Hi, Thank you for reaching out. The +1 SIM Card offer has ended. We are coming up with some exciting holiday promos very soon. So keep checking this space for more information.
M: Thanks

Gino: You may try our FLASH30 code to get 30% off should purchase
Gino: it'll end on December 15th, 2019

M: another question: suppose I have  received the Global  SIMcard,  how long the card will be valid before I top-up for the first timeï¼Ÿ

Gino: Card doesn't expire
Gino: Whenever you load credit onto your KnowRoaming account, that credit will last for nine months. 

M: does this mean I have to reload at least every nine moths?

Gino: Yes, whatever remaining account balance will expire in 9 months. If you will reload before 9 months, it will reset the counter.
Gino: Remaining balance gets carried over.

M: suppose I have \$20 balance which should be expired at 20th Dec. If I reload \$30 today, All my balance(\$50) will be valid for next nine moths ?  or just the \$30 is ?

Gino: You'll  have 9 months for the \$50.00
M: OK, that's it. Thank you very much.
