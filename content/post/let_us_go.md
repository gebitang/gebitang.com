1. Work that’s engaging
2. Work that helps others
3. Work you’re good at
4. Work with supportive colleagues
5. Lack of major negatives

4. Supportive colleagues,
5. No major negatives like long hours or unfair pay, and
6. A job that fits your personal life.
```

>**Clear tasks**, with a clearly defined start and end.</br>
>**Variety** in the types of task.</br>
>**Feedback**, so you know how well you’re doing.</br>

- Very long hours.
- Pay you feel is unfair.
- Job insecurity.

When have you been most fulfilled in the past? What did these times have in common? </br>
