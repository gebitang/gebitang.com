### update project 

```
# Add Hugo and its package dependencies to your go src directory.
go get -v github.com/gohugoio/hugo
```

$GOPATH 目录约定有三个子目录：

- src 存放源代码（比如：.go .c .h .s等）
- pkg 编译后生成的文件（比如：.a）
- bin 编译后生成的可执行文件（为了方便，可以把此目录加入到 $PATH 变量中，如果有多个gopath，那么使用${GOPATH//://bin:}/bin添加所有的bin目录）

```
$ go env
set GOARCH=amd64
set GOBIN=
set GOEXE=.exe
set GOHOSTARCH=amd64
set GOHOSTOS=windows
set GOOS=windows
set GOPATH=F:\Tools\gopath\
set GORACE=
set GOROOT=F:\Tools\go
set GOTOOLDIR=F:\Tools\go\pkg\tool\windows_amd64

dream job

day-by-day, hour-by-hour


the six ingredients

1. Work that’s engaging
2. Work that helps others
3. Work you’re good at
4. Work with supportive colleagues
5. Lack of major negatives
6. Work that fits with the rest of your life

So to say 
```
1. Work you’re good at,
2. Work that helps others,
3. Engaging work that lets you enter a state of flow (freedom, variety, clear tasks, feedback),
4. Supportive colleagues,
5. No major negatives like long hours or unfair pay, and
6. A job that fits your personal life.
```

How to engage

>The **freedom** to decide how to perform your work.</br>
>**Clear tasks**, with a clearly defined start and end.</br>
>**Variety** in the types of task.</br>
>**Feedback**, so you know how well you’re doing.</br>

What's the majoe negatives

- A long commute, especially if it’s over an hour by bus.
- Very long hours.
- Pay you feel is unfair.
- Job insecurity.


the context of the work, not the content.

When have you been most fulfilled in the past? What did these times have in common? </br>
Imagine you just found out you’re going to die in ten years. What would you spend your time doing?</br>
Can you make any of our six factors more specific? e.g. what *kinds* of people do you most like to work with?
